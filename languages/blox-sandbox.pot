However, there are many functions you may want to run that need access to the admin, such as adding/removing Genesis layout configurations, widget areas, etc. These functions will not work correctly unless this box is checked. But if you enable, your custom PHP code is run at all times. This means that if you don't know what you doing, you can easily break both the frontend and backend of your site. %1$sYou have been warned%2$s."
